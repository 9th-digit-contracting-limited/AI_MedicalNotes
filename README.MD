# Classifying medical notes into standard disease codes

**August 2017**

This repository contains the code I implemented to classify automatically EHR patient discharge notes into standard
disease labels (ICD9 codes). I implemented deep learning models ( CNN, LSTM and Hierarchical models) using embeddings and 
attention layers. The CNN model with attention outperformed previous algorithms used in this task.   
The dataset used for modeling was: [https://mimic.physionet.org/](MIMIC III dataset) .

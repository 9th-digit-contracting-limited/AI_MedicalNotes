## NN Baseline Model
A neural network (not Recurrent) with one hidden layer, with relu activation on the hidden layer and sigmoid activation on the output layer.   Using cross entropy loss,which is the loss functions for multilabel classification [4]   
   

## Evaluation
rank loss metric to evaluate performance [3] and F1 score [2]
